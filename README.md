# AI Timeline

The AI Timeline is a personal project based on a course I developed at the University of Florida (JOU 3365 Artificial Intelligence in Media and Society).

In terms of code, it's no big deal, just Bootstrap and a free theme.

The reasoning behind it: Create a simple collection of key events or milestones in the development of artificial intelligence. It's not meant to include every person or every event related to the field of AI.
